# 📊 Support Vector Regression (SVR) with Python (RBF Kernel)

This project demonstrates how to implement **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** in Python using the **RBF kernel**. SVR is a powerful algorithm for non-linear regression problems.

## 📌 What You'll Learn

- How SVR differs from Linear Regression
- Feature scaling for SVR
- Using `StandardScaler` to scale X and y
- Training an SVR model with RBF kernel
- Making predictions and inverting scaling
- Visualizing SVR results
